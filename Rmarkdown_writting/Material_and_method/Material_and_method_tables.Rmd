```{r samples_table, echo=TRUE}

# delete the doubles

(samples_def <- filter(samples, (sample_type=="bulk" & ECe_type=="ECe_bulk")|(sample_type=="rhizo" & ECe_type=="ECe_rhizo")) %>% 
  mutate(pH_water = ifelse(sample_type == "rhizo", NA, pH_water)) #we delete the pH value frome the rhizo types
)

 
 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
